# 🐍 Python Beginner Journey: Logic & Problem Solving

This repository is a collection of 11 Python projects and exercises that document my progress from basic scripts to interactive games and logical tools.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Control Flow:** Complex branching with nested `if/elif/else` statements.
* **Data Structures:** Working with 1D and 2D (nested) lists for coordinate mapping.
* **Iterative Logic:** Using `for` and `while` loops for data processing.
* **Randomization:** Implementing the `random` module for games and security tools.
* **Modern Python:** Utilizing **List Comprehensions** and advanced string methods.

## 📂 Project Highlights

### 🏆 Choice-Based Adventures
* **Treasure Island & Space Game:** Multi-level interactive stories where user choices dictate the outcome.
* **Rock, Paper, Scissors:** A classic vs-computer game using randomized selection logic.

### 🔐 Security & Tools
* **Password Generator:** A robust tool that builds high-entropy passwords based on specific counts of letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Who Pays the Bill?:** A practical application using `len()` and `random.randint()` to select a name from a list.

### 📊 Mathematics & Algorithms
* **Coordinate Treasure Hiding:** A 3x3 mapping system that translates a user's coordinate string (e.g., "A3") into a 2D array position.
* **Average Heights (Manual vs. Automatic):** Two versions showing the logic of manual counters vs. built-in functions like `sum()`.
* **Highest Score Finder:** A custom comparison loop designed to identify the maximum value in a list of data.
* **Love & BMI Calculators:** Real-world logic applications that process and categorize user input data.
