# 🐍 Python Fundamentals: Logic & Problem Solving
A collection of 11 Python scripts documenting my journey through fundamental programming concepts, mathematical algorithms, and game design.

## 🎓 Technical Milestones
* **Advanced Control Flow:** Using nested `if/elif/else` blocks for complex branching logic (e.g., Space Game, Treasure Island).
* **Data Mapping:** Translating human-readable coordinates (A1, B2) into list indices for grid-based data manipulation.
* **Algorithmic Thinking:** Calculating totals, counts, and maximum values manually to understand the logic behind built-in functions.
* **Security Logic:** Iterative password generation using character set randomization.
* **Pythonic Syntax:** Implementing List Comprehensions for efficient data processing.

## 📂 Project Catalog

### 🏆 Interactive Games
* **Treasure Island & Space Game:** Multi-level text adventures that explore deep branching logic and user choice consequences.
* **Rock, Paper, Scissors:** A classic game utilizing the `random` module to simulate a computer opponent.

### 🔐 Tools & Security
* **Password Generator:** Creates high-entropy passwords by selecting specific counts of letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Who Pays the Bill?:** A list-based randomizer that fairly selects an individual from a group.

### 📊 Math & Algorithm Logic
* **Coordinate Treasure Hiding:** A 3x3 mapping script that translates a user's input (like "C2") into a specific location in a 2D array.
* **Average Heights (Comparison):**
    * *Version 1:* Uses Python's built-in `sum()` and `len()`.
    * *Version 2:* Uses manual `for` loop counters to understand low-level arithmetic logic.
* **Highest Score Finder:** A custom comparison algorithm to find the maximum value in a dataset.
* **Even Number Summation:** Implementing the `range(step)` function for mathematical efficiency.
* **Love & BMI Calculators:** Processing user data through categorized health and logic ranges.
